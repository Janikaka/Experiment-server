##Info
`swagger.json` contains the swagger route/model definitions from swaggerhub.com. `swaggerpatcher.sh` is a script to generate diff from old swaggerfile. This is usually in situations where many people have modified different swagger-definitions at the same time.

##Usage

`./swaggerpatcher.sh <old-file> <new-file>`
